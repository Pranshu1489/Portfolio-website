Welcome to your personal portfolio! This README file will guide you through the basic setup and initialization steps to get your portfolio up and running smoothly.

## Initialization Steps
Install Pandas:
```bash
pip install pandas
```
Install Flask:
```bash
pip install flask
```
## Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
## Activate the Virtual Environment:
On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Required Dependencies:

Run the Flask Application:
```bash
python app.py
```
## Accessing the Application:
Once your Flask app is running, you should see output indicating that the server is running.
Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/, and you should see your Flask app running.
